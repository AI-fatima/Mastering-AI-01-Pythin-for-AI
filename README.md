## 1. Python Fundamentals

### 1.1 Syntax and Semantics

**Concepts:**
- Indentation: Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define the structure of code blocks (e.g., functions, loops, conditionals).
- Comments: Use `#` for single-line comments and `'''` or `"""` for multi-line comments.
- Python Scripts vs. Interactive Mode: Writing and running Python scripts versus using the interactive interpreter (REPL).

**Practice:**
1. Write a Python script that prints "Hello, World!" and run it in both a script file and the interactive interpreter.
2. Experiment with indentation errors by creating a function and deliberately misaligning some of the code inside it.
3. Add single-line and multi-line comments to a Python script and observe how they are ignored during execution.
4. Write a script that includes both a print statement and a comment. Run it in the interactive mode and in a script file.
5. Create a Python script that includes multiple print statements with different levels of indentation. Observe the behavior and correct any indentation errors.

### 1.2 Variables and Data Types

**Concepts:**
- Variables: Containers for storing data values. Variables are dynamically typed in Python.
- Data Types:
  - Primitive Types: Integer (`int`), Float (`float`), String (`str`), Boolean (`bool`).
  - Complex Types: Complex numbers (`complex`).
- Type Conversion: Converting between types using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.
- Input/Output:
  - `input()` function to take user input.
  - `print()` function to display output.

**Practice:**
1. Create variables of different types (int, float, string, bool) and print their types using the `type()` function.
2. Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
3. Convert a float to an integer and observe the loss of precision. Write code to demonstrate this.
4. Write a program that takes a userâ€™s name and age as input, then prints a greeting message including the name and calculates the year they will turn 100 years old.
5. Create a program that takes a string input from the user and checks if it can be converted to a number. If it can, convert it and print the number; otherwise, print an error message.

### 1.3 Operators

**Concepts:**
- Arithmetic Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `//`.
- Comparison Operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
- Logical Operators: `and`, `or`, `not`.
- Assignment Operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.
- Bitwise Operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`.

**Practice:**
1. Write a program that takes two numbers from the user and performs all the arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `//`) on them.
2. Create a script that compares two numbers and prints whether the first is greater than, less than, or equal to the second.
3. Write a program that demonstrates the use of all logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) by evaluating expressions and printing the results.
4. Develop a program that uses assignment operators to increment, decrement, multiply, and divide a number provided by the user.
5. Create a program that uses bitwise operators to perform AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations on two integers provided by the user. Print the binary representation of the results.

### 1.4 Control Flow (Conditionals)

**Concepts:**
- If Statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`.
- Nested Conditionals: Conditionals within other conditionals.
- Ternary Operator: `x if condition else y` (short form of conditional).

**Practice:**
1. Write a program that takes a number as input and checks if it is positive, negative, or zero. Print an appropriate message.
2. Create a script that assigns grades (A, B, C, D, F) based on a numeric score provided by the user. Use nested conditionals to handle the different ranges of scores.
3. Develop a program that takes the current time (in 24-hour format) as input and prints whether it is morning, afternoon, evening, or night.
4. Write a program that uses a ternary operator to determine and print whether a number is even or odd.
5. Create a program that checks if a given year is a leap year or not using a series of conditionals.

### 1.5 Loops

**Concepts:**
- For Loop: Iterating over a sequence (e.g., list, string).
- While Loop: Repeating as long as a condition is true.
- Loop Control Statements: `break`, `continue`, `pass`.
- Nested Loops: Loops within loops.

**Practice:**
1. Write a program to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers using a `for` loop.
2. Create a multiplication table (from 1 to 10) using nested `for` loops.

## 3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### 3.1 Classes and Objects

**Concepts:**
- Class Definition: Using the `class` keyword to define a blueprint for objects.
- Creating Objects: Instantiating objects from a class.
- Instance Attributes and Methods: Variables and functions that belong to an object.

**Practice:**
1. Define a `Car` class with attributes like `make`, `model`, and `year`, and a method `start_engine()`. Create instances and call methods.

5. Develop a `Rectangle` class with methods to calculate the area and perimeter, and attributes for `length` and `width`. Create instances and compute area and perimeter.

### 3.2 Constructors (`__init__` method)

**Concepts:**

5. Implement a `Product` class that initializes `name`, `price`, and `quantity` attributes and includes a method to calculate the total cost. Create instances and compute costs.

### 3.3 Instance, Class, and Static Methods

**Concepts:**
- Instance Methods: Operate on the instance of the class.
- Class Methods: Operate on the class itself, not on instances (`@classmethod`).
- Static Methods: Do not operate on instances or the class itself, but are included in the class for organizational purposes (`@staticmethod`).

**Practice:**
1. Add an instance method to the `Car` class that prints a statement using the car's attributes (`make`, `model`, `year`).
2. Implement a class method in a `BankAccount` class to track and return the total number of accounts created.

5. Develop a `Library` class with a class method to keep track of the number of books and a static method to check if a book is available based on a list of books.

### 3.4 Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction

**Concepts:**
- Encapsulation: Bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within one unit, and restricting access to some of the object's components.
- Inheritance: Deriving a new class from an existing class, enabling code reuse and extension.
- Polymorphism: Ability to use a unified interface to work with objects of different types.
- Abstraction: Hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts.

**Practice:**
1. Create a `Vehicle` class with basic attributes like `speed` and `color`, and a method `drive()`. Derive a `Car` class from `Vehicle` that adds specific attributes and methods.
2. Implement method overriding in the `Car` class to change how the `drive()` method behaves compared to the `Vehicle

` class.
3. Write a `Shape` class with a method `area()`. Derive `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes that implement the `area()` method differently, demonstrating polymorphism.
4. Use abstraction to define a `Payment` class with an abstract method `process_payment()` and implement this method differently in `CreditCardPayment` and `PaypalPayment` subclasses.
5. Implement a `BankAccount` class with private attributes `_balance` and methods to access and modify the balance using encapsulation.

### 3.5 Special Methods and Operator Overloading

**Concepts:**
- Magic Methods: Special methods with double underscores like `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`, `__eq__`, etc.
- Operator Overloading: Defining how operators behave with objects of your custom class.

**Practice:**
1. Implement the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in the `Car` class to provide meaningful string representations.
2. Overload the `+` operator in a `Vector` class to add two vectors by their components.

4. Implement a `Time` class to represent hours and minutes, and overload the `-` operator to find the difference between two `Time` objects.
5. Create a `ComplexNumber` class and overload the `==` operator to compare two complex numbers for equality.

### 3.6 Property Decorators and Getters/Setters

**Concepts:**
- Property Decorators: Use `@property` to define getter methods that allow access to private variables.
- Getters and Setters: Control access to private attributes with methods that encapsulate them.

**Practice:**
1. Add a private attribute `_price` to the `Car` class and control its access using getter and setter methods.
2. Use the `@property` decorator to simplify access to the `_balance` attribute in the `BankAccount` class, with validation in the setter method.
3. Implement a `Person` class with a private `_age` attribute and use getter and setter methods to enforce that age cannot be set to a negative number.
4. Write a `Product` class with private attributes for `name`, `price`, and `quantity`, and implement property decorators to get and set these attributes with validation.
5. Develop a `Rectangle` class with private attributes `_length` and `_width` and use property decorators to calculate and retrieve the area.

### 3.7 Abstract Classes and Interfaces (using `abc` module)

**Concepts:**
- Abstract Base Classes: Classes that cannot be instantiated and are meant to be inherited.
